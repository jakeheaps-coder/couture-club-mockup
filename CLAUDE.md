# Couture Club — Minky Couture Loyalty App

## What This Is

An interactive mobile app mockup for **Couture Club**, a luxury loyalty app concept for **Minky Couture** — the original luxury designer blanket brand (est. 2009, 100% women-owned). The mockup is built as a PWA (Progressive Web App) so anyone can open it in a browser or install it on their phone to tap through screens like a real app.

## The Goal

**Luxury = Loyalty.** The app exists to turn one-time blanket buyers into lifelong Minky Couture members. This is NOT a discount app — it's a velvet-rope membership experience. The app should make you feel like you've been invited into something exclusive, not handed a coupon.

### Business Objectives
- Increase repeat purchase rate by 25%
- Drive 15,000+ app downloads in the first 60 days
- Increase customer lifetime value through tiered rewards
- Create an exclusive channel for limited product drops
- Integrate the Heart of Minky philanthropic program into the loyalty experience

### Positioning
- This is NOT: "Download for 10% off"
- This IS: "Unlock your private access"
- Luxury customers don't want cheaper. They want *chosen*.

## Branding & Visual Design

### Source of Truth
Official brand guidelines: `Minky-Mini-Brand-Guidelines-FINAL-2022.pdf`

### Color Palette

| Token | Name | Hex | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Black Blue | `#1e232d` | Headings, dark backgrounds, premium sections, The Vault |
| Neutral | Cream | `#f8f5f0` | Default backgrounds (alternate with white) |
| Accent 1 | Dusty Pink | `#e4b2a0` | Sparing accent use, Heart of Minky, Petal tier |
| Accent 2 Dark | Gold | `#967952` | Buttons, key headings, active nav, CTAs |
| Accent 2 Light | Gold Light | `#e3c088` | Gold gradients, shimmer text, progress bars |
| Surface | White | `#ffffff` | Cards, list items |
| Muted | Gray | `#8b8b8b` | Secondary text, labels, inactive states |
| Navy Light | Navy Light | `#2e3547` | Gradient endpoints, card backgrounds |

### Typography

| Font | Role | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| **Ogg** (substitute: Cormorant Garamond) | Primary heading | Screen titles, product names, points display, tier names, taglines |
| **Proxima Nova** (substitute: Inter) | Body | Labels, descriptions, buttons, navigation, small text |
| **Angelic Bonques Script** (substitute: Dancing Script) | Accent | Sparing playful use only |

### Visual Rules
- Dark navy + gold = premium / VIP sections (Vault, member card, splash)
- Cream + navy text = clean / everyday sections (Home, Loyalty, Studio)
- Dusty pink = feminine accent touches, never dominant
- Gold gradients (`#967952` → `#e3c088`) for CTAs and shimmer effects
- Photography: warm tones, soft focus, cozy settings, blonde models with blankets
- No loud colors. No red SALE graphics. No discount aesthetics.
- Rounded corners: 2xl (16px) for cards, 3xl (24px) for feature cards
- Subtle shadows for depth, never harsh
- Tracking-wide uppercase for labels and categories
- Serif headings + sans body = luxury editorial feel

### Logo Usage
- **Standard:** "Minky Couture" in full script — hero sections, splash
- **Stamp/Minimized:** "MC ORIGINAL" monogram — compact spaces, app icon, member card badge
- **Embellished:** "Minky Couture ORIGINAL" with crown — core VP messaging
- Logo available with and without registered trademark symbol

## Heart of Minky Integration

Three ways the philanthropic program lives in the app:

1. **Heartbeat Dashboard** (Heart tab) — transparency tracker showing exactly where mini blanket donations went (hospital names, recipient stories, progress toward milestones)

2. **Give Back Tier** — when a user reaches Grand tier, Minky Couture makes a donation in the user's name to Primary Children's Hospital or a NICU of their choice

3. **Charity Drops** — app-exclusive limited prints where 100% of proceeds go to the $1M Primary Children's Hospital NICU pledge. Makes giving feel like a prestigious, insider event.

---

## Push Notification Strategy (3-message launch sequence)

1. **24 hours before launch:** "You're on the list. The Couture Club app launches tomorrow at 10 AM. Download now to secure your Founder's Status."

2. **At launch:** "The Club is officially open! Shop the app-exclusive Midnight Champagne collection and get 2x points on your first order."

3. **48 hours post-launch:** "Only 500 Founder spots left! Join the Couture Club today to claim your limited-edition badge and free shipping for a year."

---

## Retention Channels

- **SMS:** "Your VIP pass has arrived. Join the Couture Club for early access to the Winter Drop."
- **Influencer:** Send locked trunks opened with a code found inside the app
- **In-box:** Every physical order includes a matte-finish card — "You've got the blanket. Now get the keys to the Club."
- **Surprise & Delight:** Randomly gift travel-sized minkys to users hitting engagement milestones
- **Concierge:** App-exclusive chat line for Club Members (styling advice, order help)

---

## KPIs to Measure

- App downloads (target: 15,000 in 60 days)
- Repeat purchase rate (target: +25%)
- Average order value (app vs. non-app)
- Loyalty tier upgrades per month
- Push notification open rate
- Vault drop sell-through rate
- Heart of Minky donation tracker engagement
